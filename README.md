Today in Tableau,

I tried to visualize a 2 dimension record along their measures using the inbuilt Tableau charts and it was not really appealing.

I used Tableau's multiple Bar-chart and you can see it's not telling a good story.

Then I tried the Viola Core Chart and the story came clear.

In the process, I learnt the use of domain padding and domain densification.

Very useful techniques when it comes to complex visualizations like arcs, sankey and the likes.
